Version 1.0.0

# Discord Giveaway Bot
This is the discord giveaway bot I created for the Official Crafting Dead Discord to host our rank giveaways. 
This was my first attempt at a discord bot.

# Installation and Updating
Download by pressing the green button in the repository or:
If you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed you can clone the repository

# Bot Usage
Currently this bot is private but you can use the code to run your own bot.
1. Go to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
2. Login in with your account and under the `More` tab click developers
3. On the right click `My Apps` and Add an app. (The name does not matter)
4. Once this is done copy your `Client ID:` and put it in a text document
5. Add your bot to your server by clicking this [link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=identify%20guilds.join&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website) and adding your `Client ID:` where the URL says `client_id=`
6. Choose your server and check your discord to see if the bot has been added.
7. Next return to the Bot Page and copy the `Token` to a text file named `Discord_Bot.txt`
8. Open the `Program.cs` file in a text editor and change the path of the `sr` to where you saved your text file.
9. Now you can run the bot for your own server~

# Commands
The bot is activated by the `!` character. 
Type !help in discord to have a prompt appear and show you how to initiate the giveaway.
